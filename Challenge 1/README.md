# Challenge name: Facebook "Wall"

## Coding Platform: https://codesandbox.io/ | https://github.com
## JS library: Vue | React

### Pre-setup:
- register / login to coding platform
- create new sandbox / repository with your desired setup

### Description: 
Create "FB Wall" like mini-application, that allows users to create new posts in rich editor. Users can react to the posts through comments (textarea), max to the two levels (first "main" comment + reaction to the comment). All data are stored in localStorage and when the browser is refreshed, data are restored from this storage. 

You don't need to focus on the style of this application too much, just the functionality.

Vue - Rich Editor: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vueup/vue-quill
React - Rich Editor: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-quill

### Bonus points:
- add a like button to posts and comments
- the application will allow full CRUD (create, read, update & delete) operations to the user for both entities (posts & comments)
- collapse comments (show only the first 2 main comments & all reactions to the comments should be also by default hidden)
- paginate posts and show only the first 10 posts and the application should load the next 10 when users scroll down to a specific position
- user can specify thumbnail for each post
- use redux for state management

Main coding challenge takes about 50 minutes. After time limit, you will be prompted to send us link with your sollution in speficied coding platform. You have still possibility to gain additional bonus points outside of this interview session, but you have only next 48 hours to sends us your updated sollution. 

There are no restriction to use google / stackowerflow or other platforms. But you should be able to explain all of written code. 



Best of luck!
