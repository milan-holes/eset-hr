### Pre-setup
1. Register or log in to your chosen coding platform.  
2. Create a new sandbox or repository with your preferred setup.

### Description
Your task is to build a **mini-application similar to the Facebook Wall**. The application should allow users to:  
- Create new posts using a rich-text editor.  
- React to posts with comments (limited to two levels: a main comment + a reply to that comment).  

All data should be stored in **localStorage**. When the browser is refreshed, the data must be restored from storage.  

> **Note:** You donâ€™t need to focus heavily on styling now. In live-coding session, functionality is the main priority.

### Recommended Libraries

- **React:** [react-quill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-quill)

### Bonus Points
You can earn extra points by implementing the following:  
- Add a "Like" button to posts and comments.  
- Support full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both posts and comments.  
- Allow comments to collapse:  
  - Show only the first 2 main comments by default.  
  - Hide all replies to comments until expanded.  
- Paginate posts:  
  - Show only the first 10 posts initially.  
  - Load 10 more as the user scrolls down.  
- Let users add a **thumbnail image** to each post.  

---

### Time Limit & Submission
- The **main coding challenge** should take about **50 minutes**.  
- After the time limit, you will be asked to share a link to your solution in the specified coding platform.  
- You can still earn **bonus points** by submitting an updated solution within **48 hours after the interview session**.  

---

### Additional Notes
- You are free to use **AI tools, Google, Stack Overflow, or any other platforms**.  
- However, you must be able to explain all the code you submit.

**Best of luck! ðŸš€**
